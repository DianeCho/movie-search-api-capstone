Thinkful (https://www.thinkful.com) First Capstone Project - App integrating with Petfinder API.
https://bgerardi20.github.io/pet-adoption-api-capstone/


## Background
My entire life I have been a animal lover, but have always had a hard time finding the perfect one to adopt. With this app, that problem with cease to exist. You are able to search thousands of images, to help with picking out which one is best for you. Once you found that perfect breed, hop on over to the adoption section and find one close to you!

## Use Case
This app is for all animal lovers. A user can accomplish multiple things through my app. One can browse picturs of every dog breed; wether that purpose be to bring a smile to their face, or to research a type of dog you are curious about adopting, multiple images are readily available to browse. If you already know what type of animal you're wishing to join your family, hop on over to the adoption page. The user can then search for their new companion using the search engine. Once the input is delivered, you will be given results tailored to your search, with contact information on how to make the adoption possible.
